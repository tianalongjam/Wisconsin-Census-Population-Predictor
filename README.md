# Wisconsin Census Population Predictor

## Overview

This project predicts U.S. Census population counts for Wisconsin using regression models. Data is extracted from four independent sources — a GeoJSON, a shapefile, a SQLite database, and a satellite land-cover raster — transformed into a single tabular DataFrame, and used to train and evaluate `scikit-learn` regression models at both the county and census-tract level. Geospatial data is visualized with `geopandas` and `rasterio`.

## Data Sources

| File | Description |
|---|---|
<<<<<<< HEAD
| `counties.geojson` | Population and boundaries of each Wisconsin county |
| `tracts.shp` | Boundaries of each census tract (counties are subdivided into tracts) |
| `counties_tracts.db` | Details about housing units per tract (SQLite database) |
| `land.zip` | Land use data (farm, forest, developed, etc.) |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Extract, transform, and load data from multiple sources into a single DataFrame for ML training
- Analyze model performance using several metrics and feature impact on model score
- Plot geographical data using `geopandas`
=======
| `counties.geojson` | Population (`POP100`) and boundaries of each of Wisconsin's 72 counties |
| `tracts.shp` (+ `.dbf` / `.shx` / `.prj` / `.cpg`) | Boundaries of each census tract (counties are subdivided into tracts) |
| `counties_tracts.db` | SQLite database with `AREALAND` (land area) per county and `HU100` (housing units) per tract |
| `land.zip` | Zipped NLCD 2019 land-cover raster (`wi.tif`) — 20 land-use classes (water, forest, developed, crops, wetlands, etc.) |

## Approach & Results

Each stage adds a richer feature set and asks whether the added complexity is actually earning its keep.

### 1. Population from land area (county level)

Added `AREALAND` from the SQLite database to the counties GeoDataFrame, split 75/25 (`random_state=320`), and fit a `LinearRegression`.

- **R² ≈ 0.02** — land area on its own explains almost none of the variation in population. Large rural counties and small dense ones don't follow a consistent area-to-population relationship.

### 2. Population from housing units (county level)

Joined the `counties` and `tracts` tables in SQL, summing `HU100` per county, and evaluated with 5-fold `cross_val_score` instead of a single split.

- **R² ≈ 0.97 average (5-fold CV)**, **R² ≈ 0.996 on the held-out test set**
- Fitted relationship: `POP100 ≈ 2.39 * HU100 − 7910.46`, roughly 2.4 residents per housing unit
- Housing units are a near-tautological predictor of population — a strong forecasting signal, but one that mostly restates the target rather than explaining it

### 3. Land use as a feature (county level)

Used `rasterio` to mask the NLCD raster to each county's polygon (after reprojecting to a shared CRS) and count pixels per land-use class.

- Dane County is **~47% cropland**
- Explored the relationship between individual land-cover types (e.g., evergreen forest) and county population

### 4. Multi-feature regression at the census-tract level (individual part)

Switched to the finer-grained `tracts.shp`, engineered 20 feature columns (one per NLCD land-use class) via raster masking, and split 80/20.

- Compared a plain `LinearRegression` against a `Pipeline([StandardScaler, LinearRegression])` using cross-validation mean and standard deviation
- Both scored effectively identically (~0.515 avg R², since OLS is invariant to feature scaling) — the scaled pipeline was recommended for more interpretable, comparable coefficients
- Final model achieved **~0.39 explained variance** on the held-out test set, clearing the 0.35 target
